## The Universes

### Chaos Era
In the beginning, only **Chaos** existedâ€”a void where infinite **Particles** vibrated within a singular **Point**. Over millennia, these **Particles** formed the **Particulate Clouds**, initiating the dawn of the **Formative Era**.

### Regular Universe
A cosmos governed by **Dark Matter**, representing the physical realm akin to human experience. Restricted by conventional physics, this Universe mirrors Earth's limitations.

### Unorthodox Universe
Powered by **Originium**, this dimension serves as the essence of vitality and creativity. Denizens possess **OriginLife**, granting them immortality at the discretion of Vorvadoss.

### Magic Universe
Born from the **Negative Energy Universe** and infused with **Magic Elements**, this Universe grants its inhabitants supernatural abilities, such as control over elemental forces.

### Normal Universe
A fusion of the Regular and Unorthodox Universes, combining the energies of **Dark Matter** and **Originium** to resist external threats.

### OriginMull Universe
The final synthesis of all Universes, dominated by **Dark Matter** with traces of **Originium** and **Magic Elements**. This Universe symbolizes unity amid the chaos.
